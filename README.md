# Recommendation-engine
# Introduction
Craigslist, one of the largest online ads platform, can have a simple soultion to boost sales and enhance customer experience. Unlike its competitors it misses a basic engine which can suggest a list of complimentary products on the searched product webpage. In this project we have built a simple recoomendation engine using Amazon suugested products as reference and tools, libraies and models like beautiful soup, similarity measures, random forest and LDA for topic modelling.

# Problem
Craigslist faces several challenges related to the lack of a sophisticated recommendation system for complementary products, hindering users from discovering related items that could enhance their searches. This absence limits cross-selling and upselling opportunities, impacting the platform's revenue potential. Additionally, users may be unaware of relevant products, diminishing their overall experience and restricting engagement with a broader range of content. The platform's cumbersome interface further compounds these issues, causing frustration, longer search times, and potential dissatisfaction among users who may find alternatives more user-friendly and efficient.
